## Rust Demo Week 9

In this project, I applied two search algorithms linear search and interpolation search and make it interactively. You can use it as following:

```
Enter a list of integers separated by a space:
1 2 3 4 5 6
Enter the value to search for:
2
Choose a search algorithm:
1. Linear search
2. Interpolation search
2
2 found at index 1
```

```
Enter a list of integers separated by a space:
6 5 4 3 2 1
Enter the value to search for:
0
Choose a search algorithm:
1. Linear search
2. Interpolation search
1
0 not found in the array.
```
